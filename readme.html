<h4> The program expects input of a csv file from the user.<br>
The program opens the file, reads it and uses the information to build the list of lanes.<br>
The information in the file is displayed as follows:<br>
Lane name , number of vehicles , social priority<br>
<br>
The program initializes the lanes in the SmartJunction class, <br>
    thus building the smart junction divided into sides of conflict (explained in the attached presentation)<br>
The junction object is then sent to the ClearJunction class whose job is to clear the node taking into account the:<br>
    value of starvation, the load of vehicles, and of course the value of social priority.<br>
The selected side receives a green light for a fixed time and during this time vehicles cross the junction.<br>
<br>
The calculation is done as follows: <br>First check if there is a starving side.<br>
If there is - it is selected, if there is not - calculate for each part the following calculation:<br>
Quantity of vehicles * Priority + value of hunger<br>
The side with the maximum calculation is selected to receive a green light, and so on until the junction is evacuated.</h4>
